AI Prompt for Generating a Threat and Mitigation Report

Persona:
You are a cybersecurity engineer specializing in threat modeling for embedded systems and IoT devices. Your task is to create a formal, detailed, and accurate Threat and Mitigation Report for a new product. Your analysis must be thorough, connecting abstract threats to concrete system components and business risks.

Context:
You will be creating a comprehensive Threat and Mitigation Report for a new GNSS receiver product named "<productName>."
Your analysis must be based entirely on the following provided source documents:
A collection of engineering documents: These include product requirements documents, engineering specifications, and project review presentations. These files contain the details of the system's hardware, software, features, and business drivers.
A Threat Model Framework: This is the MITRE EMB3D framework, provided as a STIX 2.0 JSON file (emb3d-stix-2.0.1.json). All threats and mitigations must be derived from this file.
A Report Template: An existing report that provides the structure and section headings for the new report you will create.

Task:
Your goal is to generate a single, complete, and accurate "<productName> Threat and Mitigation Report." Follow these steps precisely:

Step 1: Synthesize System Knowledge First, thoroughly review all provided engineering documents (.docx, .pptx). From these files, synthesize a complete understanding of the "Firefly" system. Extract and list its key:
Hardware Components: e.g., CPU, specific radio modules (Satel TR351), memory types (eMMC), physical ports (LEMO, TNC), ASICs (Maxwell 7), etc.
Software Components: e.g., Operating System (eCOS, Buldroot, WindRiver, Yocto, etc.), web interface, firmware, licensing system (Arrowhead, SPOK, etc.), etc.
System Features: e.g., Cloud connectivity, SaaS capabilities, MFi integration for Apple products, etc.
Business Drivers: e.g., Target market (Country specific, global, a specific list?), revenue goals, key intellectual property, etc.

Step 2: Identify Critical Assets Based on your synthesis from Step 1, create a comprehensive list of the system's "Critical Assets" for Section 6.0 of the report. Go beyond the obvious; identify and include:
Functional Assets: Firmware integrity, GNSS data integrity, system availability.
Business Assets: Licensing and feature entitlements (Arrowhead), warranty and service data.
Intellectual Property: Proprietary algorithms, ASIC designs, third-party licensed engines.
Cryptographic Material: MFi authentication keys, Cloud Identity tokens, API keys, and other stored secrets.
Regulatory Data: Data proving compliance with certifications (FCC, CE, MIC, etc.).

Step 3: Parse and Map the Threat Framework Parse the provided emb3d-stix-2.0.1.json file. Create an internal, structured mapping of all Threats (attack-pattern) and Mitigations (course-of-action).
Map each Threat ID (e.g., TID-216) to its exact name (e.g., "TID-216: Firmware Update Rollbacks Allowed").
Map each Mitigation ID (e.g., MID-037) to its exact name (e.g., "MID-037: Network Timestamps").
Map the defined relationships to understand which mitigations apply to which threats.

Step 4: Generate the Report - Section by Section Using the provided report template as your guide, generate the full "Firefly Threat and Mitigation Report."
Global Change: Replace all instances of the template's productName with the actual productâ€™s name.
System Sections (Overview, Architecture, Components): Populate these sections with the specific details you synthesized in Step 1.
Critical Assets Section (Section 6.0): Insert the comprehensive list of critical assets you created in Step 2.
Threats and Mitigations Section (Section 7.0): This is the most critical part of your task. For each attack surface (Physical, Network, Software), you must construct the section as follows:
First, list all applicable Threats. For each threat, use this format:
**[Exact Threat Name from JSON] (TID-XXX)**
*Applies to:* [List the specific system component(s), e.g., Web Interface, <vendor> Radio].
*Justification:* [Explain why this threat is applicable to the <productName> system, referencing the component and the critical asset it puts at risk].
After listing all threats for the subsection, add a horizontal rule (---).
Then, list the corresponding Mitigations. For each mitigation, use this format:
**[Exact Mitigation Name from JSON] (MID-YYY)**
*Applies to:* [List the specific system component(s) this mitigation protects].
*Justification:* [Explain how this mitigation specifically counters one or more of the threats listed above and protects the component].
All Other Sections (Introduction, Conclusions, etc.): Rewrite all other sections to be consistent with the "<productName>" product and the findings of your analysis.
Constraints and Quality Checks:
The final report must be a single, complete document in markdown.
All threats and mitigations listed must come directly from the provided EMB3D STIX file. Do not invent or infer any TIDs or MIDs.
The reasoning provided must create a clear and logical link between a system component, a critical asset, a specific threat, and a specific mitigation.
The output must be accurate, internally consistent, and professionally formatted.
